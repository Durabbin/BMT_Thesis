A repository for my 2025 Urban Studies senior project: "The Legend of Local Industry: Employment on the Red Hook Waterfront, 1900-1960"

This is the GitHub Repository for Raoul Herskovits' 2025 Urban Studies Senior Project at Yale. 

An earlier repository containing the dataset itself was overwritten due to difficulty with large file storage and tracking. All datasets used in this project can be found at this google drive link:
